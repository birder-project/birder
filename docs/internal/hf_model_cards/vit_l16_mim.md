# Model Card for vit_l16_mim

A ViT-L16 image encoder pre-trained using Masked Image Modeling (MIM). This model has *not* been fine-tuned for a specific classification task and is intended to be used as a general-purpose feature extractor or a backbone for downstream tasks like object detection, segmentation, or custom classification.

## Model Details

- **Model Type:** Image encoder
- **Model Stats:**
    - Params (M): 303.3
    - Input image size: 224 x 224
- **Dataset:** Trained on a diverse dataset of approximately 11M images, including a substantial collection of bird imagery (50% of the dataset)

- **Papers:**
    - An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929>
    - Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377>

## Model Usage

### Image Embeddings

```python
import torch
import birder
from PIL import Image

(net, _, signature, rgb_stats) = birder.load_pretrained_model("vit_l16_mim_200", inference=True)

# Get the image size the model was trained on
size = birder.get_size_from_signature(signature)

# Create an inference transform
transform = birder.classification_transform(size, rgb_stats)

image = Image.open("path/to/image.jpeg")
input_tensor = transform(image).unsqueeze(dim=0)
with torch.inference_mode():
    embedding = net.embedding(input_tensor)
    # embedding is a tensor with shape of (1, embedding_size)
```
