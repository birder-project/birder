         abstractNote={CUB-200-2011 is an extended version of CUB-200 [7], a challenging dataset of 200 bird species. The extended version roughly doubles the number of images per category and adds new part localization annotations. All images are annotated with bounding boxes, part locations, and attribute labels. Images and annotations were filtered by multiple users of Mechanical Turk. We introduce benchmarks and baseline experiments for multi-class categorization and part localization.},
