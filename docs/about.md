# About Birder

Birder is an open-source computer vision framework designed for wildlife imagery, specifically focused on bird species classification and detection. This project leverages deep neural networks to provide robust models that can handle real-world data challenges.

While primarily focused on wildlife imagery, particularly avian species, Birder's adaptable architecture is designed to address a broader spectrum of computer vision challenges beyond just bird identification.
It offers a comprehensive suite of tools and models that cater to various aspects of visual analysis.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of the Birder project are:

- Accessibility: To provide an easy-to-use framework that makes advanced bird identification technology accessible to researchers, conservationists, and enthusiasts, regardless of their technical expertise
- Versatility and Efficiency: To develop and offer optimized models suitable for a wide range of hardware configurations, from small devices on trap cameras to large server installations. This ensures Birder can be used effectively in various field and research scenarios, with models efficiently adapted to different computational resources
- Accuracy: To continuously improve the accuracy and robustness of bird species classification and detection models, enhancing their reliability in real-world applications
- Research Platform: To serve as a robust and flexible research platform for AI practitioners and researchers, facilitating the development and evaluation of novel computer vision techniques for real-world environmental and ecological applications.
