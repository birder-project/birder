# Introduction

## What is Birder?

Birder is an open-source computer vision framework designed for wildlife imagery, specifically focused on bird species classification and detection. This project leverages deep neural networks to provide robust models that can handle real-world data challenges.

Unlike general-purpose image classification frameworks, Birder is tailored to the unique requirements of bird identification. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools and models that cater to various aspects of avian visual analysis, from species classification to object detection.
