# Birder Documentation

Welcome to Birder, an open-source computer vision framework specialized in wildlife image analysis, with a focus on avian species identification and detection.

## What is Birder?

Birder is a powerful framework that combines state-of-the-art deep learning techniques with domain-specific optimizations for bird species classification and detection.
Whether you're a researcher in ornithology, a conservation scientist, or a wildlife photographer, Birder provides the tools you need to analyze and understand avian imagery.

### Key Features

* **Specialized Models**: Pre-trained models specifically optimized for bird species classification
* **Practical Focus**: Built for real-world applications in ornithology and conservation
* **Comprehensive Tools**: Suite of utilities for training, inference, and error analysis
* **Production Ready**: Integration with TorchServe for deployment
* **Extensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and tutorials for all skill levels

## Quick Start

Get started with Birder in minutes:

```bash
# Install Birder
pip install birder

# Download a pre-trained model
python -m birder.tools fetch-model mobilenet_v4_m_il-common

# Run inference on an image
birder-predict -n mobilenet_v4_m -t il-common --show your_image.jpeg
```

## Why Birder?
