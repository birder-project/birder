[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable the following PyLint checks:
# C0111 - Missing docstring (missing-docstring)
# C0330 - Wrong hanging indentation before block (bad-continuation) - ignored due to black formatter
# R0201 - Method could be a function (no-self-use)
# R1703 - Used when an if statement can be replaced with 'bool(test)' (simplifiable-if-statement)
# R0801 - This usually means that the code should be refactored to avoid this duplication (duplicate-code)
# W1203 - Use lazy % formatting in logging functions (logging-fstring-interpolation)
# C0199 - First line empty in docstring (docstring-first-line-empty)
